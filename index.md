## About Me
I'm a research scientist at [Google AI, Montreal](https://research.google/locations/montreal/), where I work on improving [machine translation](https://research.google/research-areas/machine-translation/). I'm generally interested in the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.

In my PhD (Heidelberg University, Germany) I investigated how reinforcement learning algorithms can be used to turn weak supervision signals from users into meaningful updates for a machine translation system.

### Goals
One of my long-term goals is to make research in NLP more accessible, along multiple dimensions: 
1. **The long tail**: Produce research outcomes for low-resource and under-exposed languages, such that not only English-speaking users can benefit from the progress we're making in NLP. 
2. **Novices**: Reduce the entry burdens (in terms of coding and research practices)  for novices in the field, especially for new students or researchers from other related areas.
3. **Science outreach**: Get the general public, especially highschool students, more interested in research in machine learning to grow a better understanding of what our current methods look like and where their limitations are.

## News
- **Mar 2020**: *Paper accepted at the AfricaNLP workshop at ICLR.* The paper describes the efforts of the Masakhane team to build machine translation models for as many African languages as possible, by growing and fostering a distributed community of African researchers, students, and computer scientists (and more). Preprint coming soon. Until then, check out the [Masakhane project website](https://masakhane.io). 
- **Feb 2020**: I joined the *Google Translate* team in Montreal (the best city!).
- **Jan 2020**: Handed in my *thesis*. Finally.
