## About Me
I'm a research scientist at [Google AI, Montreal](https://research.google/locations/montreal/), where I work on improving [machine translation](https://research.google/research-areas/machine-translation/). I'm generally interested in the intersection of language processing and machine learning. In my PhD (Heidelberg University, Germany) I investigated how reinforcement learning algorithms can be used to turn weak supervision signals from users into meaningful updates for a machine translation system.

## News
- **Mar 2020**: *Paper accepted at the AfricaNLP workshop at ICLR.* The paper describes the efforts of the Masakhane team to build machine translation models for as many African languages as possible, by growing and fostering a distributed community of African researchers, students, and computer scientists (and more). Preprint coming soon. Until then, check out the [Masakhane project website](https://masakhane.io). 
- **Feb 2020**: I joined the *Google Translate* team as a researcher in Montreal (the best city!).
- **Jan 2020**: Handed in my *thesis*. Finally.
